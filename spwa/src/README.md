# pi_scalextric_mqtt SPWA
Simple Single Page Web Application (SPWA) testing MQTT, [check it out](https://aliceliveprojects.github.io/pi_scalextric_mqtt/spwa/src/index.html#!/index)

## Local Deployment
Before deploying the default url and port need to be changed located in brokerDetailsConstant.js

I recommend looking at the [public_brokers list](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/public_brokers).

*Using ```broker.hivemq.com``` running on port ```8000```(Websockets) works well (must use websocket ports).*

---

To deploy the SPWA :

**Install packages ```npm install```**

**To run ```node server.js```**
